The Japanese Trade Union Confederation made the heftiest pay hikes in 33 years, well higher than both recent market consensus of 3.90% and last year's rate of 3.58%. It has been previously indicated by the BOJ Governor, Kazuo Ueda, that the spring wage hikes will play a significant role in the central bank's evaluation of the feasibility of achieving the 2% price stability target in a sustainable and stable manner.",
